# Polya's Conjecture
This code is heavily based on [Dr. Beniamin Bogosel's](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~beniamin.bogosel/index.html) code, which can be found on his website. The code uses a method based on fundamental solutions to perform the standard gradient descent algorithm.

### How to Run the Code
Install [FreeFEM](https://freefem.org/), a language/extension to c++ for solving PDE's.
